### Message From Morning Star
1. There's now a main menu for when you authenticate. So far, only the quit button works.
2. I'm now tracking the version of the application. The main branch, as of writing, is at version `0.0.0 Alpha`
3. The next update should allow the encrypted server to be set up and brought to a somewhat working state.
4. I'll shift the versioning to beta once both the client and server code have been deemed functional.
