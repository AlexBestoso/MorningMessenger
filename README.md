### Message From Morning Star
1. I've provided some notes regarding how the initial startup will function. Feel free to read through them. 
2. I've also started another repository for my SoundSnake class. Which will be used to allow VOIP using this messenger. This will be prioritized after I get some sleep and point 1 is completed.
3. Enjoy the insanity.
