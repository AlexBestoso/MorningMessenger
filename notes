Server Communication Protocol: 

if already here
	+wait for client's public key and take hash of it upon recipt.
	+if key isn't trysted, close connection and exit.
	send client server public key. (Client side will also be able to validate server key)
	+if leave a message
	+	wait for message
	+	tell user if recpt was successful or not.
	+	close connection.
	else if stream chat
		server generates two AES CTR keys and IVs.
		server sends key pair to client.
		Server then creates a AF_UNIX server forked.
			socket in is routed to AF_UNIX server out.
			AF_UNIX server in is routerd to socket out.
		server master can then see that there's an active chat and join it at will.
